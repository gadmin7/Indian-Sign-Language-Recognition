## About

An attempt to formulate a technological solution to provide Real-time translation to remove:
- **Linguistic barriers:** Add ease of communication by providing various means of language translation such as text, image, or document-enabled input.
- **Sign language barriers:** Using machine learning to translate sign language to text as well as NLP to translate text to sign language.

The Digital Interface of TransApp is a Web Application through which real-time translation can take place and provide the above-mentioned facilities.
